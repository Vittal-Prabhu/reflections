  When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your files local?
   Remote repository would be helpful while you want to save your files on a remote computer accessible at all times from all computers rathen than being available only locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
There may be some change that are actually not be necessary to be stored locally.This is when we want to pull changes manually rather than having git to automatically update on itself.
